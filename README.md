# CS-330_Comp-Graphic-and-Visualization

## How do I approach designing software?
As an aspiring video game developer, I've been fascinated with learning every tool that could assist me in pursuing my goals. CS 330 Comp Graphic and Visualization has been one of my favorite classes. It has been both interesting to learn and has inspired me to look to the future and plan out my next steps in life. I will approach designing software with open arms eager to learn and create. Design software such as Unity and Unreal Engine are great next steps for 3D design. OpenGL has been great at providing me with base knowledge in this aspect of computer science. This course taught me the basics of shape, spacing, texturing, lighting, and shading in a digital 3D environment. I wouldn't say I followed a specific design process but there definitely was an order in which things we completed. First, the general shapes were placed, then the scene was textured and finally, the scenes were given light. Keeping this bare-bones process in mind will help me develop large-scale projects in the future.

## How do I approach developing programs?

Coming out of this course I can confidently say that my comfort with editing pre-existing code has increased. I've learned to recognize which functions to look for, which resources to use, and how to efficiently navigate a program. While working on my 3D scene I learned to truly appreciate commenting in code. Commenting effectively allowed me to stay organized and keep similar functions together. For example, each 3D shape was labeled and numbered. This allowed me to understand what sections of code affected what object. I also found that iterating my code was a good practice. having each shape have the same functionality made it very easy to modify any particular shape. For example, if I needed to rotate an object, the code that controlled rotation was in the same spot for every model. Taking the project in milestones really helped with the completion of my final. The project as a whole was much more manageable when working on the assignment in phases. To reflect on a previous class, I imagine this is how agile software development is conducted and why it works so well.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computational graphics and visualization have helped me better prepare myself for future educational and professional pathways. After taking this course I found that I am more comfortable with reading and writing in C++. This should help me in the future as I will be more confident with attacking a problem when faced with a large amount of code. I will be able to skim through all of the information and identify the critical elements in any challenge I face. It is my understanding that in the professional environment software engineering is the majority of maintaining and optimizing already existing code. This course definitely prepared me for this as we would be given bare-bone templates to work from and build off of.
