# CS-330_Comp-Graphic-and-Visualization

## How do I approach designing software?
As an aspiring video game developers I've been facinated with learning every tool that could assist me in persuing my goals. CS 330 Comp Graphic and Visualization has been one of my favorite classes. It has been both interesting to learn and has inspired me to look to the future and plan out my next steps in life. I will approach designing software with open arms eager to learn and create. Desiging softwares such as Unity and Unreal Engine are great next steps for 3D design. OpenGL has been great at providing me with base knowledge in this asspect of computer science. This course taught me the basics in shape, spacing, texturing, lighting and shading in a digital 3D enviroment. I wouldnt say I followed a specific design process but there definetly was an order at which things we completed. First the general shapes were placed, then the scene was textured and finally the scenes were given light. Keeping this bare bones process in mind will help me develop large scale projects in the future.

## How do I approach developing programs?

Coming out of this course I can confidently say that my comfortablty with editing pre-existing code has increased. I've learned to recognize which functions to look for, which resources to use, and how to efficently navigate a program. While working on my 3D scene I learned to truly appreciate commenting in code. Commenting effectively allowed me to stay organized and keep similar functions together. For example each 3D shape was labeled and numbered. This allowed me to understand what sections of code effected what object. I also found that iterating my code was a useful practice. having each shape have the same functionality made it very easy to modify any perticular shape. For example if I needed to rotate and object, the code that controlled rotation was in the same spot for every model. Taking the project in milestones really helped with the completion of my final. The project as a whole was much more managable when working on the assignment in phases. To reflect on a previous class, I imagine this is how agile software development is conducted and why it works so well.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computational graphics and visualization has helped me better prepare myself for future educational and professional pathways. After taking this course I found that I am more comfortable with reading and writing in C++. This should help me in the future as I will be more confident with attacking a problem when faced with a large amount of code. I will be able to skim through all of the information and identify the key elements in any challenge I face. It is my understanding that in the professional enviroment software engineering is a majority of maintaining and optomizing already exsisting code. This course definetly prepared me for this as we would be given bare bone templates to work from and build off of.
